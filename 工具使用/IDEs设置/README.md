### IDEs' Setting

1. There are **phpstorm** and **webstorm** settings. I exported `.jar` to make sure settings in my workplace and my PCs are the same.

    [phpstorm.jar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realgeoffrey/knowledge/master/工具使用/IDEs设置/phpstorm_04.06.jar)(webstorm can use too)
2. **Help -> Edit Custom VM Options** can change the memories for the IDE.
